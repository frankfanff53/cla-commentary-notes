\maketitle
\chapter*{Declaration}
This so-called "commentary notes" is based on lecture notes of MATH60024, Computational Linear Algebra, which is led and lectured by Professor Colin Cotter. 
The original notes could be found \href{https://comp-lin-alg.github.io}{here}. I would refer it as "master notes" most of the time in the following commentary.

I wrote this set of notes to explain the important points in the master notes, making extra examples and detailed proofs about concepts and theorems which is not somehow vague, and give step-by-step instructions and hints for doing the \textbf{assessed} coding exercise.

Obviously I would not show you my code directly, since it is not good for you to practice and improve the coding skills, and not fair to my dedicated 20hr+ code implementation work last year. (Well, this rule would break for some people. You would see if you go through the chapters.)

However, my hints would be aimed at helping you have a deeper understanding of the problem description and knowledge itself, and also let you to understand the implementations from scratch (I hope so :-D).

There is no need to worry if you think you didn't do the \href{https://object-oriented-python.github.io}{Priciples of Programming} module in year 2. The module is beneficial but not necessary. What you need to do is just giving yourself enough coding practice via attempting the exercises in this module (and read my hints carefully if you get stuck!). Programming is the art of craftsmanship, and dedicated practice would lead you to perfection.


You might find that I would spend time in proving theorems, although this module is totally "computational". The reason I did this is just to make sure everything could be demonstrated clearly. If you are not happy with reading proofs, feel free to skip them!

This module would be a great adventure, hope you enjoy and have lots of fun in this journey!

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Firstly I want to thank Professor Colin Cotter for providing such a brilliant set of open-sourced master notes first.
Without his extraordinary work, I cannot digest the knowledge in such a quick and enjoyable way, and come up with the idea of writing these "commentary notes". 
I hope my work would help him and students studying this module in the following years.\smallskip

My parents are also in my first place to say thanks. They are always the people I could share my feelings and find help. Special thanks to my mom - who studied mathematics in uni and worked as a maths teacher, giving me the talent in particular linear algebra and statistics. She always encouraged me to embrace opportunity of explaining studying materials to my colleagues and friends - and that's why I decided to write this document.\smallskip

Also, thanks a lot to my friends Kexin, Tiansheng and Di (pronounced as \textbf{Dee}) being the first group of readers of the notes. Their participation of reading notes and using this as additional studying material gives me extra motivation in fixing errors in sample solutions of the code, and keeping me dedicated in updating these commentary notes on track.\smallskip

I would also like to thank my two friends, who are both expecting to join and study this module in autumn 2022 - I would like to give them as the very first gift of their year 3 mathematics pathway at Imperial. Their enthusiasm for mathematics gave me the opportunity to rethink about the module, and what would I expect in the learning material if I started learning this module again.\smallskip

This project-based module might be hard, intensive with workload and deadlines, and annoying if you cannot figure about either mathematics or programming part. However, I hope this supplementary material (and/or myself) could be the place that the readers always rely on, no matter how complex or annoying the problem they encountered is.\smallskip

With my work, I hope students not only remember this module because of the multiple intensive 3-day-limited courseworks and 1-less exam in the summer term, but also the fun of understanding the maths, using maths to implement functions, and utilising functions to solve mathematical/real-word problems.
