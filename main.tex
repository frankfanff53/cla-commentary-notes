\maketitle
\chapter*{Declaration}
This so-called "commentary notes" is based on lecture notes of MATH60024, Computational Linear Algebra, which is led and lectured by Professor Colin Cotter. 
The original notes could be found \href{https://comp-lin-alg.github.io}{here}. I would call it "master notes" most of the time in the following comentary.

I wrote this set of notes to explain several vague points in the master notes, make detailed proofs about theorems which is not being explained clearly, and give step-by-step instructions for doing the coding exercise.

I also gave out something everyone always want to have - the sample solutions of coding exercises. Actually it is not typical to distribute sample solutions of exercises of a coding-based module. But my sample solutions would be aimed at helping you have a deeper understaning of the problem description and knowledge itself, and also let you to understand the implementations from scratch (I hope so :-D).

There is no need to worry if you think you didn't do the \href{https://object-oriented-python.github.io}{Priciples of Programming} module in year 2. The module is beneficial but not necessary. What you need to do is just giving yourself enough coding practice via attempting the exercises in this module (and read my explanation if you get stucked!). Programming is the art of craftmenship, and dedicated practice would lead you to perfection.


You might find that I would spend several of time in proving theorems, although this module is totally "computational". The reason I did this is just to make sure everything could be demonstrated clearly. If you are not happy with reading proofs, feel free to skip them!

This module would be a great adventure, hope you enjoy and have lots of fun in this journey!

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I want to thank Professor Colin Cotter for providing such a brilliant set of open-sourced master notes first.
Without his extraodinary work, I cannot digest the knowlege in such a quick and enjoyable way, and come up with the idea of writing these "commentary notes". 
I hope my work would help him and his students studying this module in the following years.

\medskip
\noindent Also, thanks a lot to my friends Kexin, Tiansheng and Di (pronounced as \textbf{Dee}) being the first group of readers of the notes. Their participation of reading notes and using this as additional studying material gives me extra motivation in fixing errors in sample solutions of the code, and keeping me dedicated in updating these commentary notes on track.
